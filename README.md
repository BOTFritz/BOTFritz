Fritz is an experimental Python-based bot designed to eventually rival the existing bots within Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

At present, he has some primitive vision/aiming capabilities and will also walk forward until he detects a player, at which point he will counter-strafe and begin shooting.

Improved logic, pathfinding, and object detection are in the works.

Controls: Hold ENTER/RETURN to enable Fritz. Press DELETE to close Fritz.

Note: m_rawinput must be disabled so Fritz can aim. Playing in fullscreen-windowed mode is also recommended.

Fritz is ultimately an educational undertaking that is intended for offline use, so be sure to add -insecure and +sv_lan 1 to the CS:GO launch options before testing Fritz to avoid any complications.
