Fritz is an experimental Python-based bot designed to eventually rival the existing bots within Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

At present, he has some primitive vision/aiming capabilities powered primarily by the Tensorflow Object Detection API.



Fritz is ultimately an educational undertaking that is intended for offline use, so be sure to add -insecure and +sv_lan 1 to the CS:GO launch options before testing Fritz to avoid any complications.
